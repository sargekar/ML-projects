# Implementation of Logistic Regression for UCI dataset 

The core libraries used across projects include but are not limited to:

- Python 3.8+
- NumPy
- Pandas
- Scikit-learn
- TensorFlow / PyTorch
- Matplotlib / Seaborn
- Jupyter Notebook

The goal is to showcase a practical approach to building, training, and evaluating a logistic regression model using Python and popular machine learning libraries like Scikit-learn.
Problem: Implement the Logistic Regression algorithm.

Data Set: The data set (in the folder ./data/) is obtained from the UCI Repository and are collectively the MONK’s Problem. These problems were the basis of a first international comparison of learning algorithms1. The training and test files for are named monks-3.train and monks-3.test. There are six attributes/features (columns 2–7 in the raw files), and the class labels (column 1). There are 2 classes.
Refer to the file ./data/monks.names for more details.
